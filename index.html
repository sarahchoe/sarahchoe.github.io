              <p>On April 17th, 1975, Pol POt and the Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia. Their goal: create a utopian socialist society, where everyone was equal as a rice farmer. To reach this goal, the Khmer Rouge murdered all scholars, military officers, proffesionals, and political, civic, and relgious leaders. This marked the beginning of a reign of terror or the "killing fields" in the former French colony. Among those executed to create this perfect society were the physicians. In 1975, there were around 950 people trained in the profession. After the executions, only 38 remained. When the Khmer Rouge lost power and peace was restorin in 1979, only 20 were left. Although it was only four years, Cambodia's health care system was left in shambles.</p>
              
              <p>Cambodia is now a country of approximately 14 million people. Of this number, 20% live below the povery line, survigin on less than one dallar per day. Even an average Cambodian only makes aroun $880 a year. The majority live in the countryside and farm. Life expectancy is low and access to health care varies according to where a person lives.</p>

              <p>In 2000, Dr. Dan Smith, Dr. Mark Sheehan, and Reveredn Setan Lee founded this organization, Chirsitian Medical Ministyr to Cambodia/Jeremiah's Hope or CMMCJH. Their vision: offer excellent medical care to the poor and quaility medical education to the healthcare community of Cambodia.</p>
